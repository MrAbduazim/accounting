# Impinj IoT Device Interface Protected Mode Example (Python)

This Python example script (`protected_mode_example.py`) was developed to demonstrate how the Impinj IoT device interface, when used with Impinj RAIN RFID readers, can be utilized to exercise the Impinj Protected Mode functionality of Impinj M700 series tag chips. 

The example utilizes the Python requests module to interact directly with the reader configuration REST API, which is included in the Impinj IoT device interface.  It also pulls in two referenced JSON configuration files (`config_inventory.json` & `config_tag_protect_op.json`) and uses the Python JSON module to modify the contents in memory to perform the operations specified in the [Program Summary](#program-summary) section.

The example also contains verbose comments about the purpose of the various sections of code, so please refer to the actual script for detailed information about the implementation.

## 2. Impinj IoT Device Interface - Protected Mode Overview

This section provides an overview of how to exercise Impinj Protected Mode functions on supported Impinj M700 series tag chips using the Impinj IoT device interface. 

In order to operate on tag access passwords and Impinj Protected Mode flags inventory JSON configurations include [additional JSON fields](#inventory-json-configuration-fields) that correspond to the operations required.  During inventory rounds, additional steps are taken to interact with the tag access password and Impinj Protected Mode flags according to the JSON fields provided. The reader event stream should be monitored by the user for [expected responses](#expected-responses-from-event-stream) to the tag memory writes.

[Transient configurations](#transient-configurations) in the Impinj IoT device interface are recommended for exercising Impinj Protected Mode features through the Impinj IoT device interface. These configurations are useful for applicaitons which require JSON parameters to be modified frequently and storred temporarily in memory.  

### Process Flow

The following outlines a recommended process flow for interacting with Impinj Protected Mode functionality via the Impinj IoT device interface. The example script provided follows these steps.  

NOTE: the tag filter verification feature is not compatible with Impinj Protected Mode operations.

1. Update inventory [JSON configuration with parameters](#inventory-json-configuration-fields) to execute desired functions (as necessary)
   - Tag Filters
   - Access Password
   - Protected Mode PIN
   - Protected Mode Flag
2. Begin monitoring the reader's event stream for `inventoryTagEvents` that contain the [responses relevant to the desired operation](#expected-responses-from-http-stream)
   - The event stream may be monitored by any of the available output methods in the Impinj IoT device interface: HTTP(S), MQTT, Kafka
3. Start a [transient inventory configuration](#transient-configurations) with the updated [JSON configuration payload](#inventory-json-examples)
4. Wait for the  stream to return the relevant responses
5. Stop the transient configuration after the operations are complete
6. (Optional) Repeat steps 1-5 for any subsequent operations

### Inventory JSON Configuration Fields 

In order to implement protected mode, certain JSON configuration fields are required. These fields are implmented within the the `antennaConfigs` object.  An example of a JSON configuration for common baseline operations is provided in the [following section](#inventory-json-examples).

NOTE: These JSON fields each perform a specific function and can be combined in various ways to achieve different results.  

- **tagAccessPasswordHex**: The current access password of target tags (string of 8 hex char)
  - A Non-zero password is required to enable or disable Protected Mode
  - Must be included to write new access password if the current access password on the target tag is non-zero

- **protectedModePinHex**: The current Protected Mode PIN of target tags (string of 8 hex char) 
  - Used to inventory protected tags with supplied Protected Mode PIN  
  - Mustbe included when disabling Protected Mode

- **tagAccessPasswordWriteHex**: new access password/Protected Mode PIN
  - Causes reader to write new access password (also used as Protected Mode PIN)

- **tagSecurityModesWrite**: supply value of the Protected mode flag (and short-range bit)
  - **protected**: must be supplied to exercise Protected mode flag (True/False)
  - **shortRange**: (optional) can modify short range setting (True/False), defaults to false if not supplied



### Inventory JSON Examples

The following examples showcase some ways to perform basic functions related to Impinj Protected Mode with the Impinj IoT device interface. The JSON fields relevant to Impinj Protected Mode ([see above section](#inventory-json-configuration-fields)) are contained within the `antennaConfigs` object.

- Normal Inventory (Baseline)
  > This is a basline inventory operation with nothing special occuring should be used for comparison to subsequent JSON configurations.

   > - `tagAccessPasswordWriteHex` is supplied to change the access password to non-zero, which is required to enable Impinj Protected Mode. This field is optional if the current access password is non-zero.
   > - `tagSecurityModesWrite` and the included `protected` flag are supplied to modify the Impinj Protected Mode flag on the tag chip.
   > - A filter is added so that the Impinj Protected Mode and password/PIN change operations will only be applied to a single tag.

   ```


### Expected Responses from Event Stream

NOTE: "Event Stream" refers to the output data stream of the reader. This data stream can accessed via any of the available data output methods from the Impinj IoT device interface: (ex: HTTP stream, MQTT, etc)

When `tagAccessPasswordWriteHex` or `tagSecurityModesWrite` is supplied in a configuration JSON which is started on the reader, the reader event stream should return the result of those operations in the response from each tag that responds to the inventory round.  These will appear in the `tagInventoryEvent` response object and will look like the following: 

- If `tagAccessPasswordWriteHex` is included in the JSON config, expect:
  `"tagAccessPasswordWriteResponse":{"response":"success"}`
- If `tagSecurityModesWrite` is included in the JSON config, expect:
  `"tagSecurityModesWriteResponse":{"response":"success"}`

The value of the `response` field may be one of several options: 
```
success
tag-memory-overrun-error
tag-memory-locked-error
insufficient-power
nonspecific-tag-error
no-response-from-tag
nonspecific-reader-error
not-attempted
failure 
```
Please refer to the [REST API documentation](https://platform.impinj.com/site/docs/reader_api/index.gsp) for full details on the available responses.

An example of a full response from a tag may look like the following (taken from an HTTP stream output):

`{"timestamp":"2021-07-09T23:35:59.278427551Z","hostname":"impinj-13-f8-f5","tagInventoryEvent":{"epcHex":"E2801190A5021F80055817CA","antennaPort":1,"peakRssiCdbm":-2650,"transmitPowerCdbm":3000,"tagAccessPasswordWriteResponse":{"response":"success"},"tagSecurityModesWriteResponse":{"response":"success"}}}`
### Transient Configurations

**Background:** Traditional configuration presets may be saved to the reader disk, which is useful for keeping configurations that will not change frequently.  Because exercising Impinj Protected Mode functionality will often require filtering for specific tags and supplying unique passwords per transaction, the RAIN RFID configuration JSON values will likely need to update frequently when performing Protected Mode operations.  Because of this, using the traditional configuration presets for these functions will result in many disk writes, which could reduce the life the disk over continued use.  

**Feature:** To mitigate the risk of additional writes on the disk, transient configurations may be used to start JSON configuration presets and storing them in memory only (not written to disk).  These transient configurations are started immediately, and they are not saved to disk when stopped.  If a reader is rebooted while a transient configuration is active, the active configuration will be lost and the reader will boot up into an idle state.  The intent of these transient configurations is to perform short-lived operations that may change the configuration frequently, which is why they are a good fit for exercising Protected Mode functionality of Impinj M700 series tag chips.

**Usage:** To start a transient inventory configuration, perform an HTTP POST request to the `/profiles/inventory/start` endpoint in the reader configuration REST API.  The payload of this POST request is the JSON configuration which will be started.  Active transient configurations are stopped like any other active preset, by performing an HTTP POST request (no body) to the `/profiles/stop` endpoint.
